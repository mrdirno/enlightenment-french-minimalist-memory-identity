## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where the protagonist encounters a new 'client' whose collection of objects tells a story that directly mirrors a suppressed memory of his own.
- Create a chapter from the perspective of Madame Leclerc, the concierge, as she observes Julien and pieces together her own theory about the white room and its purpose.
- Write a 'found document'—the contents of the locked leather-bound notebook from the table, revealing a secret that changes Julien's interpretation.
- Imagine a prequel story showing Julien's first commission as a *débarrasseur* and the traumatic event that led him to adopt his minimalist system.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'White Room' website where users can click on 12 minimalist objects to reveal fragments of a story, then rearrange them to form different narratives.
- Create a text-based game where the player, as Julien, must walk through Parisian streets making observational choices that affect their 'psychic noise' level and ability to interpret the objects.
